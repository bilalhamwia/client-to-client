# Stalk - multi client chat app
This is desktop application for chatting between users. Including registration, login, your profile, real time online friends and chatting rooms.

<b>How to run</b>

First you must have your own database named 'team_speak' or change in code -> Frame.class

on line 55: database = new DatabaseManager(database_name,"root",""); 

and table named 'users' Its complicated to change because it is almost in every class.

Second you have to run Server.class as a single run.
